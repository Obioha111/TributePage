            <p> <strong>Nnamdi Azikiwe </strong>  was born on 16 November 1904 in Zungeru, Northern Nigeria. His first name means "my father is alive" in the Igbo 
                language, and his parents were Igbo. His father, Obed-Edom Chukwuemeka Azikiwe (1879-1958), a native Onye Onicha, was a clerk 
                in the British Administration of Nigeria who traveled extensively as part of his job. Azikiwe's mother was Rachel Chinwe 
                Ogbenyeanu (Aghadiuno) Azikiwe, who was sometimes called Nwanonaku and was the third daughter of Aghadiuno Ajie. Her family 
                descended from a royal family in Onitsha, and her paternal great-grandfather was Obi Anazenwu. Azikiwe had one sibling, a sister
                named Cecilia Eziamaka Arinze.As a young boy Azikiwe spoke Hausa, the regional language. His father, concerned about his son's
                fluency in Hausa and not Igbo, sent him to Onitsha in 1912 to live with his paternal grandmother and aunt to learn the Igbo 
                language and culture. In Onitsha, Azikiwe attended Holy Trinity School (a Roman Catholic mission school) and Christ Church 
                School (an Anglican primary school). In 1914, while his father was working in Lagos, Azikiwe was bitten by a dog; this prompted
                 his worried father to ask him to come to Lagos to heal and to attend school in the city. His father was sent to Kaduna two 
                 years later, and Azikiwe briefly lived with a relative who was married to a Muslim from Sierra Leone. In 1918, he was back in
                  Onitsha and finished his elementary education at CMS Central School. Azikiwe then worked at the school as a student-teacher,
                supporting his mother with his earnings. In 1920, his father was posted back to southern Nigeria in the southeastern city of
                 Calabar. Azikiwe joined his father in Calabar, beginning secondary school at the Hope Waddell Training College. He was introduced
                  to the teachings of Marcus Garvey, Garveyism, which became an important part of his nationalistic rhetoric.

                Azikiwe became governor-general on 16 November 1960, with Abubakar Tafawa Balewa as prime minister, and became the first Nigerian
                named to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. When Nigeria became a republic in 1963, he was its first president. In both 
                posts, Azikiwe's role was largely ceremonial. He and his civilian colleagues were removed from office in the 15 January 1966 
                military coup, and he was the most prominent politician to avoid assassination after the coup. Azikiwe was a spokesman for Biafra 
                and advised its leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, during the Biafran War (1967–1970). He switched his allegiance back to Nigeria
                 during the war, and appealed to Ojukwu to end the war in pamphlets and interviews. The New York Times said about his politics,
                  "Throughout his life, Dr. Azikiwe's alliance with northerners put him at odds with Obafemi Awolowo, a socialist-inclined leader 
                  of the Yoruba, the country's other important southern group." After the war, he was chancellor of the University of Lagos from 
                  1972 to 1976. Azikiwe joined the Nigerian People's Party in 1978, making unsuccessful bids for the presidency in 1979 and 1983.
                  He left politics involuntarily after the 31 December 1983 military coup. Azikiwe died on 11 May 1996 at the University of Nigeria 
                  Teaching Hospital in Enugu after a long illness, and is buried in his native Onitsha.

            <h2 style="text-align:center; padding-top:30px;">QUOTES</h2>
            <p>Here are some great quotes of Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe during his life time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is plenty of room at the top because very few people care to travel beyond the average route. And so most of us seem satisfied to remain within the confines of mediocrity</li>
                <li>The realization of New Africa can only be possible by the African cultivating spiritual balance, which leads to the practicalization of social regeneration, to realizing economic determination, becoming mentally emancipated, and ushering in a political resurgence.</li>
                <li>Originality is the essence of true scholarship. Creativity is the soul of the true scholar</li>
                <li>Blessed are the common people. God loves them; that is why he made millions of them.</li>
                <li>My stiffest earthly assignment is ended and my major life's work is done. My country is now free and I have been honoured to be its first indigenous head of state. What more could one desire in life?</li>
                <li>No matter how old an individual may be, no matter if he is young or old, if he thinks in accordance with the times he is immortal</li>
                <li>It is better we disintegrate in peace and not in pieces</li>
                <li>Despite the mythic heights to which he was raised, Azikiwe was nothing if not pragmatic, a realist always conscious of his limits and ever eager to extract all that was possible from that limited horizon.</li>
                <li>Israel has created a new image of the Jew in the world - the image of a working and an intellectual people, of a people that can fight with heroism.</li>
            </ul>
